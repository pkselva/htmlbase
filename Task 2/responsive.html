        <p>Hard work will undoubtedly pay off. Hard work is a necessary component of our lives, as history has shown. There is no such thing as success in life without hard work. An unproductive individual who is always seen relaxing will never succeed. It is impossible to achieve success without putting in a lot of effort. People are always looking for shortcuts, 
            but there are none in life. Everything hinges on your ability to work hard and how you approach problems. To reach your goals, you must work hard, be determined, and stay focused on your goals. A man is like steel; if it is utilised, it shines; if it is not used, it rusts. If you have truly worked hard, it will certainly pay off, and you will undoubtedly
            enjoy your success; however, if you live your dreams, you will end up only dreaming. You must be determined and dedicated to your work in order to achieve your goal. If you are studying, you must be committed to your academics and work hard to achieve higher grades; if you are working, you must be committed to your job. Hard labour pays off in the end, as 
            history has shown. We have all heard about the efforts successful people have put in to make a life. A perfect example of this would be A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the Former President of India. He was known to sell newspapers as a child. Look at what he is today. He is called the Missile Man of India. Many like him have become living examples of how even the worst 
            situations can lead you to the best of situations.</p>
